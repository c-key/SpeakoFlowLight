# Build Instructions

This guide covers how to set up the development environment and build SpeakoFlow from source across different platforms.

## Prerequisites

### All Platforms

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) package manager
- [Tauri Prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

### Platform-Specific Requirements

#### macOS

- Xcode Command Line Tools
- Install with: `xcode-select --install`

##### Intel Mac (x86_64)

Intel Macs build **CPU-only**. `Cargo.toml` arch-gates the Metal GPU backend to
Apple Silicon, because ggml's Metal backend targets Apple Silicon and upstream
whisper.cpp/llama.cpp carry open reports of it (and MoltenVK-Vulkan) producing
corrupted output or failing to build on Intel Macs. Transcription still works;
small Whisper models are usable, large ones are slow.

Intel Macs also need one extra step. Prebuilt ONNX Runtime binaries are not
available for `x86_64-apple-darwin`, because pykeio's `ort` dropped that target, so
ONNX Runtime has to be installed separately and linked dynamically:

```bash
brew install onnxruntime
ORT_LIB_LOCATION=$(brew --prefix onnxruntime)/lib ORT_PREFER_DYNAMIC_LINK=1 bun run tauri dev
```

The same environment variables apply for production builds:

```bash
ORT_LIB_LOCATION=$(brew --prefix onnxruntime)/lib ORT_PREFER_DYNAMIC_LINK=1 bun run tauri build
```

> **This produces an app that only runs on your machine.** Homebrew's dylib
> records an absolute path into your Cellar as its install name, so the `.app`
> will fail to start on any Mac without that exact formula installed. That is
> fine for building for yourself, and it is why CI does it differently: the
> "Stage ONNX Runtime for Intel macOS" step in
> [.github/workflows/build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml) copies the dylib
> into `src-tauri/onnx-libs/`, rewrites its install name to `@rpath/...` _before_
> linking, and ships it inside `SpeakoFlow.app/Contents/Frameworks`. Don't
> distribute a locally built Intel `.dmg`; use a CI artifact.

Intel macOS is currently built in `test-build.yml` only, and is not yet part of
any release. See [issue #19](https://github.com/AbhishekBarali/SpeakoFlow/issues/19).

#### Windows

- **MSVC with the C++ workload.** Visual Studio 2019/2022 with "Desktop
  development with C++", or the standalone Build Tools:

  ```powershell
  winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools --override `
    "--quiet --wait --norestart --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools --includeRecommended"
  ```

  A Visual Studio install *without* that workload is not enough. Watch for two
  specific symptoms: `VC\Tools\MSVC\<ver>` with no `include\` directory and
  only `lib\onecore\` (the CRT headers and desktop import libs are missing),
  and a missing `VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat` (so `vcvars64.bat` fails).
- **cmake** — `whisper-rs-sys` and `transcribe-cpp-sys` invoke it from their
  build scripts: `scoop install cmake` or `winget install Kitware.CMake`.
- **LLVM/libclang** — `bindgen` needs it: `scoop install llvm` or
  `winget install LLVM.LLVM`, then set `LIBCLANG_PATH` to its `bin` directory
  if the build cannot find `libclang.dll`.
- **Vulkan SDK** — the x86_64 build enables ggml's Vulkan backend, whose shader
  step needs `glslc` plus the Vulkan headers and import lib:
  `scoop install vulkan`, or
  [LunarG's installer](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows). Set
  `VULKAN_SDK` to the install root if cmake reports
  `Could NOT find Vulkan (missing: Vulkan_LIBRARY Vulkan_INCLUDE_DIR glslc)`.

`scripts/dev-env.win.bat` sets all of this up and runs whatever you pass it
(`scriptsdev-env.win.bat cargo check`). Adjust the five paths at the top for
your machine.

Run `cargo` from a *Developer Command Prompt* (or after calling
`vcvars64.bat`). A plain Git Bash shell puts its own `link` ahead of MSVC's
`link.exe` on `PATH`, which fails as `LNK1104`.

Two more Windows settings worth making before the first backend build. Both
concern the same two crates — `transcribe-cpp-sys` and `whisper-rs-sys` — and
changing either one afterwards means deleting
`target/*/build/transcribe-cpp-sys-*` and `whisper-rs-sys-*` first, because
the choice is baked into their CMake caches:

- `set CMAKE_GENERATOR=Ninja` (`scoop install ninja`). Left alone, cmake picks
  the newest Visual Studio instance it can see, which fails outright if that
  one lacks the C++ workload (*"could not find any instance of Visual
  Studio"*); and under a Visual Studio generator, ggml's nested
  `vulkan-shaders-gen` project re-configures from inside MSBuild and reports
  *"No CMAKE_C_COMPILER could be found"*. Under Ninja it inherits the `cl.exe`
  already on `PATH`.
- `set CARGO_TARGET_DIR=C:ctsfl` (any short path). `vulkan-shaders-gen`
  nests its build directory deep enough that the PDB path inside its compiler
  probe crosses 260 characters, and MSVC reports that as
  `fatal error C1041: cannot open program database` — misleadingly, since the
  same error normally means parallel `cl.exe` writes and is answered with
  `/FS`. A short target directory is the actual fix. This matters most when
  the repo itself sits several directories deep.

#### Linux

- Build essentials
- ALSA development libraries
- Install with:

  ```bash
  # Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install build-essential libasound2-dev pkg-config libssl-dev libvulkan-dev vulkan-tools glslc libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev libgtk-layer-shell0 libgtk-layer-shell-dev patchelf cmake

  # Fedora/RHEL
  sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
  sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel pkgconf openssl-devel vulkan-devel \
    gtk3-devel webkit2gtk4.1-devel libappindicator-gtk3-devel librsvg2-devel \
    gtk-layer-shell gtk-layer-shell-devel \
    cmake

  # Arch Linux
  sudo pacman -S base-devel alsa-lib pkgconf openssl vulkan-devel \
    gtk3 webkit2gtk-4.1 libappindicator librsvg gtk-layer-shell \
    cmake
  ```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <this fork>
cd SpeakoFlow-Light
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### 3. Start Dev Server

```bash
bun tauri dev
```

### 4. Build for Production

```bash
bun run tauri build
```

This compiles a release binary and generates platform-specific bundles (deb, rpm, AppImage on Linux; dmg on macOS; msi on Windows).

## Linux Install (from source)

The raw binary (`src-tauri/target/release/speakoflow`) cannot run standalone — it needs Tauri resource files (tray icons, sounds, VAD model) to be co-located at the expected path.

### Arch Linux

From the repository root, run the Arch installer:

```bash
bun run install:arch
```

It installs any missing build dependencies with `pacman`, builds the current
checkout, and installs a self-contained copy for the current user under
`~/.local`. It also creates the `speak` and `speakoflow` terminal commands and a
desktop application entry. `~/.local/bin` must be on `PATH` to use the terminal
commands (it is by default on most Arch desktop setups).

To install an existing release build without recompiling, or to use another
prefix:

```bash
./scripts/install-arch.sh --skip-build
./scripts/install-arch.sh --prefix /absolute/path
```

The installer keeps the bundled `libtranscribe`/`libggml` speech-engine files in
an app-private directory instead of copying their generic library names into
`/usr/lib`.

### Debian bundle extraction

**Install from the deb bundle** (works on any Linux distro):

```bash
cd /tmp
ar x /path/to/SpeakoFlow/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/deb/SpeakoFlow_*_amd64.deb data.tar.gz
tar xzf data.tar.gz
sudo cp usr/bin/speakoflow /usr/bin/
sudo cp -r usr/lib/SpeakoFlow /usr/lib/
sudo cp -r usr/share/icons/hicolor/* /usr/share/icons/hicolor/
sudo cp usr/share/applications/SpeakoFlow.desktop /usr/share/applications/
```

After subsequent rebuilds, only the binary needs re-copying:

```bash
sudo cp src-tauri/target/release/speakoflow /usr/bin/
```

Resources only need re-copying if they change upstream (new icons, sounds, etc.).

## Troubleshooting

### AppImage build fails on Arch / rolling-release distros

`linuxdeploy` bundles its own `strip` binary which is too old to process system libraries built with newer toolchains on rolling-release distros (Arch, CachyOS, Manjaro, EndeavourOS).

The error from Tauri:

```
Bundling SpeakoFlow_*_amd64.AppImage
failed to bundle project `failed to run linuxdeploy`
```

Tauri swallows the real linuxdeploy error. To see it, run linuxdeploy manually:

```bash
cd src-tauri/target/release/bundle/appimage
~/.cache/tauri/linuxdeploy-x86_64.AppImage --appimage-extract-and-run \
  --appdir SpeakoFlow.AppDir --plugin gtk --output appimage
```

**Workaround:** The binary, deb, and rpm bundles all build fine — only the AppImage step fails. To skip it:

```bash
bun run tauri build -- --bundles deb
```

Then install using the deb extraction method above.
